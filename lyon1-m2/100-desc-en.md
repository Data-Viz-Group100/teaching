[Daily Weather Data for Austin (TEXAS):](https://data-viz-group100.github.io/station-climatique-austin.github.io/)

We have data on the climate of the city of Austin, the data are: temperature, sea level, wind speed, as well as fog visibility). We have different statistics (average, values: Max, Min). We need an account on how to react is very much, climate change is correlated, make a regression to see how the measures evolve over time, see seasonality, cyclicity as well as the auto- correlation of observations for each measure.
